This is an effort to make Hunspell compatible xTalk Syntax (Scripting/Programming Languages) Spelling Dictionary. The dictionary file is based on the Syntax of OpenXTalk / LiveCode Community Edition implementation of xTalk. It currently consists of a sorted list from returned lists of the commandNames, the functionNames, the propertyNames, and idePropertyNames(), it is missing the message names (such as mouseUp, mouseDown, mouseExit, etc.) and has not yet been "munched" (the affix file is empty).
